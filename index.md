## Hello !

I'm Jade, a current sophomore studying Computer Science and Mandarin Chinese at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill!

Welcome to my Github page that I created and customized using Jekyll's static site generator. Here I would like to share my personal projects, hobbies, and other interests as a way to practice and experiment with coding. 

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jadehenderson/jadehenderson.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
