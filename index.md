## Hello !

I'm Jade, a current sophomore studying Computer Science and Mandarin Chinese at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill!

Welcome to my Github page that I created and customized using Jekyll's static site generator. Here I would like to share my personal projects, hobbies, and other interests as a way to practice and experiment with coding. 

### Projects !

Nonograms: A simple logic puzzle where given a board along with row and column clues, a player will shade/eliminate cells to complete the puzzle. I completed my first GUI/Java desktop app using JavaFx.   

### Hobbies !
