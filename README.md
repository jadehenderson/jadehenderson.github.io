# Welcome to my Github page!

I created this page using a Jekyll theme to get started and decided to add my own customizations from there. I am using this page as a way to host my personal projects as well as any current interests and hobbies I have. 

This page is also being used to experiment with git, html/css, markdown, etc. as a way to gain experience and knowledge programming on my own.
